Certainly, I'll provide a breakdown of the content in the image:

Question Label: Q2

Instruction:
Provide here the report portion pertaining to Lab 1, paragraphs (c) and (d).

Question Content (c):
Determine the gain k and the theta offset

Image Description:

There's a schematic drawing labeled "FIGURE 9: Nonlinearity introduced by servo-angle potentiometer."
It appears to depict an electrical circuit involving a motor system.
There's a block labeled "V(t)" connected to another block labeled "Km" and "s+θ1", which is then connected to a feedback loop represented by an "angle θ" symbol.
The feedback loop feeds back to the "V(t)" block.
Answer for (c):
The offset was determined to be 4.212 with a gain error of 1.3576° creating this as the Senwiong = 1.3576°/(angle) - 4.212;

Question Content (d):
Motor stiction

Answer for (d):
CW: -0.476V
CCW: -0.476V
We incrementally increased the voltage until the motor moved. This created a stiction offset is 0.476V in either direction.
